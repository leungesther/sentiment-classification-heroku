1st: Deepavali Specials - the items listed under “Deepavali Draw” in the new design are NOT the same as those advertised in the Straits Times. Previously, they were the same and there was a clear and obvious designed category “Deepavali Specials” that I could click on to get the full list of items on offer.

2nd: 3-day Weekend Offers: This is not listed at all today in the new design. In the old design of the app, it was uploaded every Friday, to sync with the newspaper advertisement. Plus, users only needed to click “3-day Weekend Offers” to see all items on offer in this category in the old design.

3rd: Brands Offers: The old design was so easy and intuitive to use - just a click on the freebies from the different brands, users would see the various items of that specific brand to buy. Now, users only see the freebie & statement like “Free pan with $60 purchase”. Click it, users only see the free pan!

It is not honest and causes disadvantages to people to tell someone to wait for 15 minutes, only for the delivery to come 2 hour later. I can not go anywhere, if i knows it will be more than 2 hours late, i will finish my other tasks first.

The customer service is not reliable in servicing customer.

The driver on the other hand, called my husband that he will arrive 5-7 minutes. But 20 minutes later, the driver is not here yet.

2) Photos are so tiny! Please see and compare Redmart.

3) Product Title so long that you can’t see unless you click each item! So you have to guess which flavour you want click and see if you got the right box!  Please learn from Redmart.

4) So many different sub categories of sale items and deals going on. And always sold out when you check out. Arggh irritating.

5) Delivery cost is too high. Again compare Redmart to stay competitive. And why if we opt for pick up, the rebate $3 is only for next purchase? $3 doesn’t even cover carpark costs, I mean seriously...

2020-07-29 12:59:28,"Legit complaints from a frequent shopper I really hope NTUC succeeds in its foray into the digital space so hear me out here. 

1. Bad UX

- i can search when I’m not signed in, and when I want to add to my cart I have to sign in which is fair. But when I do, the stuff that I saw that was available is suddenly unavailable. For example, Pampers Premium Care.

- search results are not sorted according to type or relevance! Which is the bare minimum of an e-commerce app. For example, when I search for rice noodles, the first five results are rice noodles or noodles then a trickle of irrelevant products then rice noodles appearing then irrelevant products then rice noodles etc. Why??

- some search results are not relevant! when I search for “rice noodles” I am shown tomato paste, olive oil, canola oil, virgin coconut oil, mustard dressing etc. Why???

- after search results are displayed I have to scroll upwards manually to view starting from top to bottom. Why doesn’t it display from the top results?

- can you please place all the unavailable items towards the bottom of the search results instead of weaving them intermittently within the available items?

2. Bad fulfilment

The delivery service is really superb. On time, and within the same day of ordering even. However, I refrain from ordering fresh items like chicken or vegetables after a couple times bad experience where I was allocated stale chicken and very old vegetables. To be fair, Sheng Siong and RedMart both do poorly on this category. So should NTUC treat this gap as a major opportunity to outshine your competitors?

3. Bad inventory management

About 50% of the time, my confirmed orders are updated to exclude a couple of items that are not available.

100% of the time, many items that I want to buy aren’t available. I’m hard pressed to fill my cart of items worth $79 because so many items are unavailable!",1,Leahpenelope,appstore,7,2020,1,0.9734,0.125,legit complaint frequent shopper really hope succeeds foray digital space hear bad ux search signed want add cart sign fair stuff saw available suddenly unavailable example pampers premium care search result sorted according type relevance bare minimum e commerce example search rice noodle first five result rice noodle noodle trickle irrelevant product rice noodle appearing irrelevant product rice noodle etc search result relevant search rice noodle shown tomato paste olive oil canola oil virgin coconut oil mustard dressing etc search result displayed scroll upwards manually view starting top bottom display top result please place unavailable item towards bottom search result instead weaving intermittently within available item bad fulfilment delivery service really superb time within day ordering even however refrain ordering fresh item like chicken vegetable couple time bad experience allocated stale chicken old vegetable fair sheng siong redmart poorly category treat gap major opportunity outshine competitor bad inventory management time confirmed order updated exclude couple item available time many item want buy available hard pressed fill cart item worth many item unavailable

I explained to her that the pg card means the holder is already past the senior age and should be valid for the senior discount. Eventually I showed her my IC to prove my age is higher than the senior age

I also told her that in my frequent shopping at Ntuc all over spore, she is the first one who insists on seeing a silver card before granting the senior discount
